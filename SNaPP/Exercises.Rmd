## Data Generation Excercise

### Let's start by reading in the data. I'll call it `duncan`.

```r
duncan <- read.table("https://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Companion/data/Duncan.txt")
```

### Now to answer some questions about the data:

#### Summarize the data: 
* How many variables are there?  
  I'd say `r ncol(duncan)`, but I'm not happy with that answer.
* How many cases?  
  I'd like to say `r nrow(duncan)`.
#### Look at subsets of the data:
* What is the value of the education variable for the 35th case?
* What is the mean of the education variable?
* How many different types of occupations are there?
* Which cases in the data have a prestige value greater than 85?
* View the value of all cases of the prestige variable that are greater than 85
* View the dataset for all cases in which prestige is higher than 85
